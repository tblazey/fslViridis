# fslViridis

Goal of this mini project is to port the great perceptually uniform colormaps from matplotlib (https://bids.github.io/colormap/) to FSL's fslview.

This project contains LUTs for  
1. Viridis  
2. Inferno  
3. Plasma  
4. Magma  

There is also a little jpeg image for each map. Finally, there is a simple Python script that creates lookup tables for fslview from matplotlib colormaps.
